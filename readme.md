Introduction:
In the fast-growing e-commerce industry, efficient delivery route optimization is essential to reduce delivery time and cost. This project implements a graph-based algorithmic approach to determine the most optimized delivery paths. Using techniques like Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Searching, and Sorting, this system finds the most efficient route for package deliveries.

Objective: 
•	To develop an optimized delivery routing system using graph algorithms.
•	To implement various algorithmic techniques to find the best route with minimum cost.
•	To analyze the efficiency of different algorithms for real-world logistics

Features: 
Interactive Menu-Driven System for easy user input.
Graph-based Delivery Route Planning using Dijkstra & Floyd-Warshall.
Greedy Optimization for cost-effective path selection.
Dynamic Programming for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Divide & Conquer Sorting (Quick Sort / Merge Sort) for prioritizing urgent deliveries.
Binary Search for fast location lookup.
Graph Visualization using Graphviz (Optional).
Technology Used: 

Programming Language: C++ 
Development Environment: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or any C++ compiler 

Data Structures Used:
•	Arrays & Linked Lists – For storing delivery locations.
•	Stacks & Queues – For processing delivery tasks.
•	Graphs (Adjacency Matrix & List) – To represent the road network.
•	Trees – For efficient route selection

 Advantages:
Fast & Cost-Effective: Uses multiple algorithms to reduce delivery cost & time.
 Scalable: Can handle large delivery networks efficiently.
 Real-World Application: Ideal for logistics companies & e-commerce platforms.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use menu system with simple inputs.

     make a plan for how i fuel and cost efficent it is 


      1->
     //think in grah when you want to go from 1 to 6 how many of locations  between the paths 
     //example if you want to from jiit to  warehouse3 uske bich m kn kn se pad rhe paths protn krna h pura 

     //*** paths print 


     2->

     CHECK HOW SHORT PATH OR DIRECT DILEVERY USING DIJASTRA AND FORDWRASHALL 


     3--> 4️⃣ Cost Calculation – Har ride ka estimated fuel cost calculate ho jaaye (based on distance and mileage).
     2️⃣ Multiple Delivery Stops – Agar ek se zyada jagah pe delivery karni hai, toh Multi-stop optimization add kar sakta hai (TSP – Travelling Salesman Problem use karke).

     1️⃣ Real-time Traffic Consideration – Agar baad me API integration karega, toh Google Maps ya OpenStreetMap ki API use karke real-time traffic data le sakta hai. Fir dynamic speed calculation ho sakti hai.

     6️⃣ Priority-Based Delivery Sorting – Urgent deliveries ko alag prioritize kar sake sorting algorithms se.
