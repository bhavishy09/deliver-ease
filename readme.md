Introduction:
In the fast-growing e-commerce industry, efficient delivery route optimization is essential to reduce delivery time and cost. This project implements a graph-based algorithmic approach to determine the most optimized delivery paths. Using techniques like Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Searching, and Sorting, this system finds the most efficient route for package deliveries.

Objective: 
•	To develop an optimized delivery routing system using graph algorithms.
•	To implement various algorithmic techniques to find the best route with minimum cost.
•	To analyze the efficiency of different algorithms for real-world logistics

Features: 
Interactive Menu-Driven System for easy user input.
Graph-based Delivery Route Planning using Dijkstra & Floyd-Warshall.
Greedy Optimization for cost-effective path selection.
Dynamic Programming for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Divide & Conquer Sorting (Quick Sort / Merge Sort) for prioritizing urgent deliveries.
Binary Search for fast location lookup.
Graph Visualization using Graphviz (Optional).
Technology Used: 

Programming Language: C++ 
Development Environment: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or any C++ compiler 

Data Structures Used:
•	Arrays & Linked Lists – For storing delivery locations.
•	Stacks & Queues – For processing delivery tasks.
•	Graphs (Adjacency Matrix & List) – To represent the road network.
•	Trees – For efficient route selection

 Advantages:
Fast & Cost-Effective: Uses multiple algorithms to reduce delivery cost & time.
 Scalable: Can handle large delivery networks efficiently.
 Real-World Application: Ideal for logistics companies & e-commerce platforms.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use menu system with simple inputs.
